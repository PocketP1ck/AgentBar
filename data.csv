"ChemCrow","Science, Chemistry","ChemCrow is an open source package for the accurate solution of reasoning-intensive chemical tasks It integrates 13 expert-design tools to augment LLM performance in chemistry and demonstrate effectiveness in automating chemical tasks Built with Langchain The LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output. It is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation. One interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results. (Source: Weng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). LLM-powered Autonomous Agents"".

Various human-designed prompt engineering techniques have been proposed to improve problem solvers based on Large Language Models (LLMs), yielding many disparate code bases. We unify these approaches by describing LLM-based agents as computational graphs. Each node implements a function to process multimodal data or query other LLMs. Each edge describes the information flow between operations and agents. Graphs can be recursively combined into larger composite graphs representing hierarchies of inter-agent collaboration. Our novel automatic graph optimizers (1) refine node-level LLM prompts (node optimization) and (2) improve agent orchestration by changing graph connectivity (edge optimization).

SWE-agent works by interacting with a specialized terminal, which allows it to: -  Open, scroll and search through files -  Edit specific lines w/ automatic syntax check -  Write and execute tests This custom-built interface is critical for good performance. Simply connecting an LM to a vanilla bash terminal does not work well. ""Our key insight is that LMs require carefully designed agent-computer interfaces (similar to how humans like good UI design). E.g. When the LM messes up indentation, our editor prevents it and gives feedback."" SWE-agent was released by the Princeton NLP team. What makes SWE-agent special is that it performs almost as well as Devin on the SWE-bench. It is important to say that the performance varies based on the model used by the agent. The changes and innovations in SWE-agent compared to Devin are: - The code in SWE Agent is executed locally via Docker. - It uses “Agent-Computer Interface” (ACI) - constraining the interface makes the agent easier to use for LMs. Only a few commants are allowed: run code, look for code, edit code and submit changes to GitHub. Any code the agent writes goes through a syntax check (linter) before being submitted. If the syntax is incorrect, the agent gets feedback and is forced to redo the code. The agent can only read 100 lines of code at a time, rather than the entire file. This makes it easier for the language model to understand the code.","Main: https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-agent | GitHub: https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-agent | Web: https://swe-agent.com/ | Demo: https://swe-agent.com/demo | Discord: https://discord.com/invite/AVEFbBn2rH"
